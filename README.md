# Antivist 2.0 #<br>
Antivist is a indie game written in Java. It's a complete remake of Version one and does not use any game libaries / APIs.<br>
The main idea behind this game is:<br>
* Create and play different stories (levels)<br>
* Unlock a lot of new items and characters<br>
* Develop your characters by playing the base story line<br>
* Create your own stories (levels/textures/sounds/blocks/mobs/etc.) and share them with the community<br>
* Vote and comment on a player's story and get it "story of the day"<br>
* The story of the day will be automatically downloaded by the game and is playable after the game started<br>
* If the story fits in the main story line it will be added by us<br>
