# Antivist 2.0 #
Antivist is a indie game written in Java. It's a complete remake of Version one and does not use any game libraries | APIs.
*****
The main idea behind this game is
 * Create and play different stories (levels)
   * Unlock a lot of new items and characters
   * Develop your characters by playing the base story line
   * Create your own stories (levels/textures/sounds/blocks/mobs/etc.) and share them with the community
 * Vote and comment on a player's story and get it "story of the day"
 * The story of the day will be automatically downloaded by the game and is playable after the game started
 * If the story fits in the main story line it will be added by us
## Feel free to contribute to this project and share your ideas :) ##
